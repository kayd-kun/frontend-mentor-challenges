## My Process

I went with mobile first approach. First trying to build the mobile version while at the same time keeping in mind that the desktop implementation will be a simple one.

### Built with

- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile first workflow

### What I learned

I got a better understanding on how to make a site responsively. Though there are things that I might have done better. I have yet to learn them all.

I also learned how to make a color image overlay which I got stuck at for about a day.

- for that, we just create a child div for overlay with position absolute with the parent having relative.
- give the child div background color of your choice and then top:0; that finishes the touch.
- if you have something, bring it front or back by using z-index.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Not Mobile-first workflow 
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This was my first FrontendMentor challenge that I did. It was also a project that I took on my own after "learning" from tutorials. I was able to revise a lot of concepts that I learnt in the tutorial. You will only truly learn anything once you take a project on your own. 

I was able to get a full grasp of CSS Grid and Flexbox. 
I guess the code might have gotten clunky, I will revisit it once I am better and make it cleaner.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development

I should try on more of the challenges so that I have a firm understanding of the basic HTML, CSS and JS before I start learning a framework. I felt weak when I was trying to put the logic of the app together. That made me realize I should do more of the Data Structures and Algorithm exercises to build up my problem solving capability.

### Useful resources

- Mostly I went to MDN resources to get what I wanted. These guide helped me revise the concepts of layout designing.
